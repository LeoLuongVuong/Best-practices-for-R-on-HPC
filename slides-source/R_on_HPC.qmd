# Motivation


## Why R on HPC?

- Computation takes lots of time
- Large dataset, not enough RAM
- Many different scenarios to compute

::: {.fragment}
Or any combination of these
:::


## Is it hard?

::: {.callout-warning}
There is a learning curve
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
It's not rocket science

:::: {.fragment}
- Training is available
- Support is there to help

# Wrap up

## Conclusions

- Running R on HPC is easy
- Running R on HPC efficiently... [requires care]{.fragment}


## How to proceed?

If necessary, take trainings

- HPC intro
- Linux intro
- Contact support

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
If you are a programmer, consider parallelization
