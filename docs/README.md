There are many good reasons to use R on HPC infstructure, but that
might be somewhat intimidating.  This training is for you if you want
to learn what the benefits are and how to get started.

However, you will also learn about potential pitfalls and how to avoid
them.  This training is not just about the good parts, but also about
how to avoid the bad parts.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * be able to judge when to switch to an HPC environment;
  * be able to run a job on an HPC cluster that uses R;
  * be able to use R packages that are not installed by default;
  * be able to determine how long your computation will take;
  * be able to determine how much memory your computation will need;
  * be able to estimate the efficiency of your computation;
  * know the basics of how to run your R computations efficiently;
  * know how to profile your R code to find opportunities for optimization.

can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/R-on-HPC).


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use R on HPC systems.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience working with R.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.  Familiarity with Linux and HPC systems is a plus, but not
a hard requirement.
